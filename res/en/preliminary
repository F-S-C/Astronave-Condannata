Laying on the sand, you're enjoying the sweet heat of the tropical sun...\nNow the sun is burning harder, you're in the desert and there's not a trace of an oasis...\nYou suddenly wake up in your cabin, the one of the 'Neutronia' commander. It's really hot. Too much. There must be something that doesn't work.
