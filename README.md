"_L'Astronave Condannata: un'avventura_" is a game created by Enrico Colombini and Chiara Tovena, released as _freeware_ and modified (with the author's permission) by the team F.S.C., that has decided to revisit the original game from a mother point of view, realizing it using C++ and the **Unreal Engine 4**.

## The Plot

A sudden accident put your ship in danger. Only you can avert the impending disaster saving the passengers' (_and yours!_) lives.

## The Reasons Behind this Project

### Preface

The team **F.S.C.** &mdash; _Five Student of Computer Science_ &mdash; has decided to revisit the original game in modern key, using the **C++** language and making it _cross plattform_.

### The Idea

The idea was born after the ending of the course of _Algorithms and Data Structures_ held by Professor _Stefano Ferilli_: as a project for the exam, the Professor gave us the code of the original game (to which various students have added their own functions) as a base to be extended with other actions. Sadly, the entire project was poorly documented and the instructions used were often obsolete and deprecated in modern C++ compilers.

**From there, our idea:** to completely rewrite the entire project (taking advantage of it to make it similar to a modern game), starting from the original base given us by the Professor (and initially published by **Enrico Colombini**). All this while creating a good documentation for the project and sharing it using _GitHub_.
